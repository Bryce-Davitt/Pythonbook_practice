 Core Data & Math Tools
NumPy – Fast numerical computing, arrays, vectorization (essential for speed).

Pandas – Powerful data structures (Series, DataFrames) for time series and structured data.

SciPy – Statistical functions, optimizers, interpolation, signal processing.

 Finance & Trading Specific
yfinance – Easy access to Yahoo Finance data (great for prototyping).

pandas-datareader – Pulls in financial data from various sources (FRED, IEX, etc).

QuantLib – Heavy-duty quantitative finance library (fixed income, options, term structures).

bt – Flexible backtesting library for strategy development.

zipline – Algorithmic trading backtester (used by Quantopian; slower but more structured).

ffn – For performance metrics, tear sheets, and portfolio analytics.

 Machine Learning & Stats
scikit-learn – Standard ML library: regressions, trees, clustering, preprocessing.

XGBoost / LightGBM – Gradient boosting models for performance-critical ML tasks.

statsmodels – Regression models, time series models (ARIMA, GARCH), hypothesis testing.

⏱️ Time Series / Signal Processing
arch – Advanced time series modeling: ARCH, GARCH, volatility modeling.

tslearn / darts – More specialized time series ML tools.

TA-Lib / ta – Technical analysis indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands.

 Optimization & Math
cvxpy – Convex optimization (great for portfolio allocation, risk parity, etc.).

PyPortfolioOpt – Portfolio optimization toolkit (mean-variance, Black-Litterman).

sympy – Symbolic math (good for derivations or working with analytical models).

 Misc / Productivity
Jupyter – For writing notebooks and sharing research.

matplotlib / seaborn / plotly – For plotting, charting, and interactive visualization.

joblib / multiprocessing / numba – Speedups via parallelism and JIT compilation.

Optional but Nice:
alphalens – For analyzing alpha factors (designed for Quantopian).

backtrader – Another solid backtesting library (more OOP, good community).

PyTorch / TensorFlow – Deep learning, useful for NLP or reinforcement learning strategies.
